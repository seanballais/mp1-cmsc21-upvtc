# mp1-cmsc21-upvtc
Nothing really interesting. Just storing our code for our first Machine Problem in CMSC21 in UPVTC. Because Sean is lazy, he won't really document much about the project, only how to build the source.

### Compiling
To compile the source, just type this in the Terminal.

    $ cd /path/to/source    
    $ make
    $ ./bin/gradingbook # To run the binary

**NOTE:** Required SQLite3.
